/**
 * <p>This package contains two main classes that implement the Java FSUIPC SDK. This code, written by Mouseviator (2020), is based upon 64 bit Java SDK by Paul Henty who amended 32 bit SDK by Mark Burton.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The two main classes are: {@link FSUIPCWrapper} and {@link FSUIPC}. The {@link FSUIPC} class is preferred for usage. The {@link FSUIPCWrapper} is sort of low level wrapper for
 *  FSUIPC and should be used when the {@link FSUIPC} does not suit your needs - ie. you don't like it. The {@link FSUIPC} uses {@link FSUIPCWrapper} internally.</p>
